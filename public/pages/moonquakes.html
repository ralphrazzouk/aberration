			<h1>About Moonquakes</h1>
			<p>
				There are three types of moonquakes large enough for us to observe them at great distances. They are deep moonquakes, those caused by
				meteoroids, and shallow moonquakes.
			</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Deep Moonquakes</h2>
			<p>
				Deep moonquakes are the most common type, reaching up to two thousand quakes detected per year during the Apollo lunar seismic
				experiment. They occur about halfway to the center of the moon. However, the most intriguing part of deep moonquakes is the regularity
				in time of their occurrence, showing a clear correlation with the tidal periodicity of the moon. No such quakes have been identified
				on Earth, likely due to the lack of sufficiently sensitive seismographs. Despite their large numbers, the total energy released by
				them is quite insignificant in comparison with that of earthquakes (Lammlein et al., 1974). Deep moonquakes appear to represent merely
				a process of storage and release of tidal energy without a significant release of tectonic energy. (Nakamura, 1978; Koyama and
				Nakamura, 1980)
			</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Meteoroid Impacts</h2>
			<p>
				The next most abundant type of moonquakes is those formed by meteoroid impacts. About three hundred of them were observed yearly by
				the Apollo seismic network. They are obviously of external origin and are in no way comparable to earthquakes.
			</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Shallow Moonquakes</h2>
			<p>
				The third and rarest type of moonquakes is the shallow moonquakes. They were detected only four to five times yearly by the Apollo
				seismic network. However, they represent the most energetic sources in the moon, and account for most of the seismic energy released
				in the moon. They occur at depths generally shallower than about 100 km (Nakamura et al., 1979), and appear to be the only moonquakes
				that may be related to earthquakes in their origin.
