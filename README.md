# Our Website

Head over to https://aberration.dev to view our website in action.

# Summary

[Aberration.dev](https://aberration.dev) is a website that was developed for the purpose of visualizing the moonquakes caused by several different events. The website comes with various different features to increase user experiences such as a fully interactive 3D model of the moon with settings to alter the lighting, rotation, and camera options. However, the main feature is that it also allows the user to see the different moonquakes on the surface of the moon as well as the different modules that sent the data. With the use of [aberration.dev](https://aberration.dev), a lot of time could be saved rather than analyzing scientific data shown on disorderly spreadsheets.

# Usage

**If you are interested in running the source files:**

1. Download the repository as a zip file and extract it in your preferred directory.
2. Open a terminal instance in the folder `./aberration` and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to launch a local instance.
4. You should now be prompted an address locally to open to view the website (something along the lines of `127.0.0.1:5173`)
5. Now, you are free to enjoy the website and play around with all the different options

This is not the end of the project. We hope to continue pushing frequent updates to add more models and features to the website. Feel free to use this code as open-source. If you have any questions or ideas for future work, please email me personally at rlphrazz@gmail.com
